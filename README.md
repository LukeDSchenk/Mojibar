# Mojibar 🙂👭🏂🐳🐆🦎©🈲🆖😯 (first beta release 🌞🥴🌝)

A quick access tab and search bar for emojis. Simply click the emoji you want to use and it will be copied to your clipboard. Want to try it out before you decide if you like it? Click here to [try out Mojibar in your browser](https://lukedschenk.github.io/Mojibar/) (note that the desktop version will offer more than the basic click-to-copy functionality).

## Installation Instructions 📄

#### Linux 🐧

Give me a moment to figure out how I want to do this 🥴.

#### Mac 🍎

For now, Mac users (or any unix-like OS user for that matter) can follow the same instructions as Linux ⬆.

#### Windows 🪟

If you're a chach and you use windows you need to be patient 🥴.

## Known Issues

* Emojis are all monochrome! (I know it sucks! I didn't realize when I started but the UI framework I used makes all emojis monochrome. I thought this problem would be fixed by using a custom font but it was not ☹. I will do whatever it takes to remedy this, I just hope it doesn't end up forcing me to switch UI frameworks.)
* The search bar has some weird issues where certain substrings will match on emojis where other more "complete" substrings of a word will not. Actively looking into solutions for this.

## Coming Soon 🕦

* Some docs for windows
* UI improvements
* Search improvements
* Select emoji with keyboard
* Keyboard shortcuts
* More supported emojis
* Improvements to make it more speedy to use

## Future 📡🚀🤖

Features I want but am not prioritizing right now.

* Favorite emojis
* Emoji categories
* Custom fonts?
* Basically a cooler copy of the emoji functionality of slack or IOS, etc. but it works on any platform and isn't tied to a single app
* Run this program as a daemon of sorts that is bound to a keyboard shortcut so it can be accessed and closed extremely quickly
* Emojipedia integration! For learning 📒
* Some kind of API for integrating into other apps so each app doesn't have to make their own damn emoji toolbar???!
