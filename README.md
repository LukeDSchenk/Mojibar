# Mojibar (still very early development)

A quick access tab and search bar for emojis. Simply click the emoji you want to use and it will be copied to your clipboard!

## Coming Soon

* Search bar
* UI improvements
* Many more supported emojis
* Hover for emoji descriptions

## Down the line

Features I want but am not prioritizing right now.

* Custom fonts
* Favorite emojis

# To Do

* Switch up the Emoji struct to use a u32 unicode scalar instead of a char
  * Also reparse the emoji.json file with Python so that it can deserialize into a vector
