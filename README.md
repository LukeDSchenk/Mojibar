# Mojibar (still very early development)

A quick access tab and search bar for emojis. Simply click the emoji you want to use and it will be copied to your clipboard!

## Coming Soon

* Search bar
* UI improvements
* Many more supported emojis
* Hover for emoji descriptions

## Down the line

Features I want but am not prioritizing right now.

* Custom fonts
* Favorite emojis

# To Do

* Make it so the default window size is somewhat large, but once you set up a favorites tab you can default it to opening small and only showing favorites, or favorites and search, etc.
* Make some random emojis pop up in the window title on each run
