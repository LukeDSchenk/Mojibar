This folder contains some different files storing emoji data. As of right now, Mojibar loads emojis in from 'emojis.txt' with no additional data involved. 


## Emoji Trie Notes
Create a Trie data structure, where the branches are the keywords of each emoji. The data stored on the end nodes of said branches will then be a struct containing the actual emoji and its name.
